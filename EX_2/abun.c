/* This function uses a for loop to iterate through the numbers 1 to n-1 and 
checks if each number is a divisor of n. If it is, it adds the divisor to a 
sum. After the loop finishes, the function checks if the sum of the divisors is
greater than n. If it is, the function returns true (1), indicating that n is 
an abundant number. If the sum is not greater than n, the function returns 
false (0), indicating that n is not an abundant number.*/
